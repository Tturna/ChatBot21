# ChatBot21
A custom virtual assistant bot for personal use. It is supposed to mimic the famous Amazon Echo or "Alexa" and improve on the idea.
The plan is to run this on a Raspberry Pi in the future. For now, it is run and developed on a Windows PC.

## This project is currently frozen, but I want to continue it at some point.

Currently the system supports features like...

- Google searching
- Wikipedia searching
- Playing YouTube videos
- Telling about recent news
- Telling about current weather

... and many others.

Some of the future plans for this project can be found in the "Projects" tab.
